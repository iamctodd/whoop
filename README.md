- [X] Add a requirements.txt and try to run some methods on a venv
- [X] Migrate existing .py & .JSON from [projects](http://github.com/philip-papasavvas/projects) repository
- [ ] Interpret output from habitdash API, and store keys & fields
- [ ] Develop new, novel plots for visualising data

# Plots & Ideas
